    "Starbucks Corporation, the most popular coffee chain in the world, has an estimated revenue of over $26.5 billion (2019) and around 33,833 store locations in 70 countries (2021). Since the opening of the first Starbucks in 1971, its growth over the last 50 years clearly shows its success in fulfilling its mission to *\"inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one cup, and one neighbourhood at a time.\"* [Starbucks Marketing Strategy](https://www.studysmarter.co.uk/explanations/business-studies/business-case-studies/starbucks-marketing-strategy/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of Starbucks stems from its efficient use of its marketing mix, delivering the right product with the right price at the right place with the reinforcement of the right promotions delivered across various channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starbucks is well-known for offering the right product due to its very uniform quality of food, beverage, and service. Enter any Starbucks establishment and you will always get what you expect from this trademark brand. This is probably one of the reasons behind its ability to foster long-term customer relationships and patronage. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the appeal of consistency, Starbucks is able to add a dose of uniqueness in the design of its store across different locations, like the Starbucks branch in Japan that resembles a traditional tea house or the one in Bangkok that resembles a Thai farmhouse. Aside from these cultural adaptations, Starbucks has a pricing system that draws in their target demographic in each country. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starbucks has a very strong promotion strategy that do not only include traditional channels like billboards, newspapers, and magazines. It believes in using the word of mouth and the power of Instagram by encouraging its customers to post pictures of their products witht he promise of rewards. It also encourages customer loyalty and purchases through the launch of Starbucks Rewards. Coupled with a mobile app that provides recommendations based on purchase history and a convenient \"order and pay\" system that allows customers to pay in advance before picking up their beverage, it is no wonder that Starbucks has captured a following of this magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its intriguing success, the Starbucks Reward system has been chosen as a project for the Udacity Nanodegree in Machine Learning Engineering Capstone Project. The data provided for this project simulates the offers sent out to the users of its mobile app as well as their response to these offers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the simulation, Starbucks sends out an offer to its users. This can be an informational advertisement about a new drink or product or an actual offer that allows the user to redeem a discount or a BOGO (a buy one get one free) promotion after purchasing a minimum amount within a set duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the study is to track patterns in customer response based on their demographic in order to optimise the distribution of Starbucks promotions by using completed orders as the metric of success. Although it may seem straightforward, there is a degree of challenge in finding out whether the customer was actually aware of the promotion during the completion of the promotion. In other words, it is quite possible that the  customer has reached the target amount within the prescribed duration without even viewing the offer. In this case, the promotion cannot be classified as successful in encouraging customer purchase as the customer would have made the same transaction without the reinforcement of this promotion."
